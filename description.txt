Adds a completely new custom systems for rolling modifiers on items (weapons, accessories and armor!)
Modifiers are similar to vanilla prefixes, but much more powerful. They can change numerical stats of items, or alter them completely both in use and way they look!
The mod also adds the ability to reforge regular armor items, this means you can start getting vanilla prefixes on them.

See the homepage for greater detail about the mod.
